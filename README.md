# Endfield Factory Compressor

A tool to optimize the layout of factory automation blueprints in *Arknights: Endfield* by minimizing the map area occupied while maintaining production efficiency.

## Overview

In Endfield, the "Infrastructure" (基建) system involves building automated production pipelines. Given a target product, the required buildings are fixed. The optimization challenge is to minimize the floor space used, which primarily involves optimizing connections between power towers and buildings.

## Project Goals

- Automate the optimization process for factory layouts
- Find the smallest possible blueprints for given target products
- Minimize power tower and building connection overhead
